âœ”ï¸Ž Get up and running with Docker Compose in minutes  
âœ”ï¸Ž Hassle free setup of local development environments  
âœ”ï¸Ž Pre-configured services for included LEMP containers

**Stack**

## Usage

1. Place `docker-compose.yml` and `docker/` into your project directory
2. See the `.env.example` for a list of supported environment variables
3. Get Docker up and running

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can access your local development environment either via `http://localhost` or `https://localhost` in your browser. By default, Nginx points to `public` as the document root.
